# Recommendation System using Deep Learning

This is a simple pseudocode for the paper Deep Neural Networks for Youtube Recommendation. I will be updaating the code step by step to implement the complete model. Along with this, I hope I can integrate neural network based embedding to the Recommendation system. This will add another layer of non-linearity.

I have also added the pseudocode for the neural network for entity embedding into this repository. Some changes are needed for the code to work with the files provided. Refer comments in the file to make the necessary changes.
