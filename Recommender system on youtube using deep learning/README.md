# Recommendation System using Deep Learning

This is a simple pseudocode for the paper Deep Neural Networks for Youtube Recommendation. I will be updaating the code step by step to implement the complete model. Along with this, I hope I can integrate neural network based embedding to the Recommendation system. This will add another layer of non-linearity.
